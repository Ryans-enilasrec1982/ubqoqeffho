Just stumbled out of the theater and, man, my back is killing me. Those chairs must’ve been designed by someone who hates spines. Anyway, Becoming Led Zeppelin, where do I even start?

The noise was like a thousand bees in a tin can during the intro. Jimmy Page's first strum felt like thunder crashing on my skull, or maybe that was just the guy munching on popcorn behind me—seriously, dude sounded like a woodchipper. But as they say, music's gotta hit you like a subway train you never saw coming, right? Flickers of the band's early days, their lockers overflowing with the future, or was it my popcorn bucket? I don’t know, it’s all a blur.

> At one point, they’re talking about the formation of the band, images popping on screen like forgotten memories dripping in colors too bright. Robert Plant’s hair looked practically aflame - like a lion with a grudge. I half expected him to start roaring about lemons or something. I could almost taste the sweat from those early gigs, the air thick enough to chew. 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  , someone whispered, or maybe that was in my head - I swear 𝘰𝘯𝘭𝘪𝘯𝘦 sharing lives in my brain rent-𝘧𝘳𝘦𝘦 these days.

And then Bonzo’s drums hit, and the screen felt alive, like a heart beating outside a body. Can’t shake that visual. Siren call of nostalgia pulled me in deeper, all muddled in the noises of the credits rolling. The ending was a tsunami of sound, waves crashing over memories not even mine but held close all the same. My thoughts did a rendition of their own, half-baked but feverish.

John Paul Jones whispered in the background - understated genius, and I forgot, for a moment, that I was scrunched in a chair that should be outlawed by some human rights convention. Did you say to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again? Probably not, but it’s the kind of thing you end up doing, half-remembering, like the taste of vinyl records and the mist of old concert halls.

Random memories swirled, a soup of sound and color and perhaps, a sprinkle of magic dust. The way they made chaos look like a dance, a peculiar structure of anarchy beautifully controlled.

bool isRealityDistorted = true;

if (isRealityDistorted)
{
    Console.WriteLine(What a ride...);
    return true;
}

Yeah, not sure where that came from, but hey, it’s been that kind of night.
